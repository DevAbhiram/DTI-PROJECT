        <h1>Essential Guidelines for Safe Driving</h1>
        <p>Developing safe driving habits is key to ensuring not only your safety but also the safety of others on the road. Here are some essential guidelines to follow:</p>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h2>1. Always Wear Your Seatbelt</h2>
            <p>Seatbelts save lives. Make it a habit to buckle up before starting your vehicle. It’s the simplest way to protect yourself in case of an accident.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h2>2. Avoid Distractions</h2>
            <p>Stay focused on the road. Avoid using your phone, eating, or engaging in any activity that diverts your attention from driving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h2>3. Follow Speed Limits</h2>
            <p>Speed limits are established for a reason. Always adhere to them and adjust your speed according to road conditions and traffic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h2>4. Respect Traffic Signals</h2>
            <p>Obey all traffic signals and signs. They are there to guide you and ensure the safety of all road users.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h2>5. Maintain a Safe Following Distance</h2>
            <p>Keep a safe distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you. This gives you enough time to react in case of sudden stops.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h2>6. Don’t Drive Under the Influence</h2>
            <p>Avoid driving if you have consumed alcohol or drugs that impair your ability to drive safely. Always arrange for a designated driver if needed.</p>
