            <h2>Contributing Factors to Traffic Accidents</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speeding:</strong> A major contributor to road fatalities. Driving above speed limits reduces reaction time and increases the severity of crashes.</li>
                <li><strong>Alcohol Impairment:</strong> Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of accidents, especially during the nighttime and on weekends.</li>
                <li><strong>Seatbelt Usage:</strong> Failure to wear seatbelts is a significant factor in traffic fatalities, especially in high-speed crashes.</li>
                <li><strong>Motorcycle Accidents:</strong> Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable on the road, with accidents often resulting in severe injury or death.</li>

            <h2>What Can Be Done to Improve Road Safety?</h2>
            <p>There are proven measures that can reduce the number of road accidents, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing safer road designs</li>
                <li>Improving vehicle safety technologies</li>
                <li>Enforcing stricter traffic laws</li>
                <li>Promoting public awareness about road safety</li>
