        <h1>Safe Driving Practices</h1>
        <p>Safe driving practices promote responsibility on the road, helping prevent accidents and safeguarding communities. Here are some essential practices every driver should follow:</p>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>1. Always Wear Your Seatbelt</h2>    
            <p>Wearing a seatbelt is one of the simplest and most effective ways to protect yourself in a vehicle. It significantly reduces the risk of injury or death in an accident.</p>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>2. Avoid Distractions</h2>
            <p>Stay focused on the road by avoiding distractions such as texting, talking on your phone, or adjusting the radio while driving. If you need to make a call or send a message, pull over safely first.</p>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>3. Follow Speed Limits</h2>
            <p>Speed limits are set for a reason. Always adhere to posted speed limits and adjust your speed according to road conditions, traffic, and weather.</p>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>4. Use Turn Signals</h2>
            <p>Always use your turn signals to indicate your intentions to other drivers. This helps prevent accidents by ensuring that everyone is aware of your movements on the road.</p>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>5. Maintain a Safe Following Distance</h2>
            <p>Keep a safe distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you. This gives you enough time to react in case of sudden stops or emergencies.</p>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>6. Never Drive Under the Influence</h2>
            <p>Avoid driving if you have consumed alcohol or drugs that impair your ability to drive safely. Always arrange for a designated driver or use public transportation if needed.</p>
